Congratulations to Le-Cong Thanh, Dr. Le Dinh Xuan Bach and Prof. Huynh Quyet-Thang for the acceptance of their ICSE 2022 (Rank A*, Acceptance Rate = 22%) NIER paper titled "Toward the Analysis of Graph Neural Networks"

<!--more-->
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as an effective framework for representing and analyzing graph-structured data. GNNs have been applied to many real-world problems such as knowledge graph analysis, social networks recommendation, and even COVID-19 detection and vaccine development. However, unlike other deep neural networks such as Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNNs), few verification and property inference techniques exist for GNNs. This is potentially due to dynamic behaviors of GNNs, which can take arbitrary graphs as input, whereas FFNNs which only take fixed size numerical vectors as inputs. This paper proposes GNN-Infer, an approach to analyze and infer properties of GNNs by extracting influential structures of the GNNs and then converting them into FFNNs. This allows us to leverage existing powerful FFNNs analyses to obtain results for the original GNNs. We discuss various designs of CNN-lnfer to ensure the scalability and accuracy of the conversions. We also illustrate CNN-Infer on a study case of node classification. We believe that CNN-Infer opens new research directions for understanding and analyzing GNNs.
